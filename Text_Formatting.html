<h1>Text Formatting in Action</h1>

<p>
This is a <b>bold statement</b> inside a normal sentence.  
Sometimes we need to mark something as <strong>very important</strong> so readers notice it.
</p>

<p>
You can add emphasis with <i>italic words</i> or highlight meaning with <em>emphasized text</em>.  
For example, scientific names are often written in <i>italics</i>.
</p>

<p>
Certain terms may be <u>underlined</u> for clarity, while others can be <mark>highlighted</mark> to stand out.
</p>

<p>
Chemistry formulas like H<sub>2</sub>O use subscripts, and math expressions like x<sup>2</sup> use superscripts.
